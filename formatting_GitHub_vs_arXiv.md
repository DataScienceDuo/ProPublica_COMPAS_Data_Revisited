Formatting GitHub vs arXiv
================



Here I list a few formatting differences between the GitHub markdown
version of my July 8, 2019, arXiv paper in this repository and the PDF
version in the arXiv website. The (default) *formatting* for the
markdown file on GitHub is a bit different. In particular:

  - The text is not justified
  - The Tables and Figures are not centered
  - The Tables have striped row shading

In the GitHub version I also made two sets of edits regarding the
display of web links to references.

  - In the *References* section, when available, I added web links to
    the reference materials, to make internet navigation easier for the
    reader.
  - I edited footnote 45 slightly; I no longer display the lengthy
    website URL for ProPublica’s GitHub repository, but do keep an
    active link to it.

In the GitHub version I also corrected two minor typos:

  - In the caption for Figure 3 I corrected a typo (before I said
    *Recividism* instead of *Recidivism*).
  - At the end of section 5, when discussing the Confusion Matrix
    results by race, I corrected a typo regarding one mention of the
    false positive rate, where I had written ‘(**FPV**)’ instead of
    ‘(**FPR**)’.
